This module supports

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation, a single
      number or a tuple.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
      sides for :attr:`padding` number of points for each dimension.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also
      known as the à trous algorithm. It is harder to describe, but this `link`_
      has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters, of size:
          :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{out\_channels}{in\_channels}\right\rfloor`.

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`dilation` can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimension
        - a ``tuple`` of two ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the height dimension,
          and the second `int` for the width dimension
