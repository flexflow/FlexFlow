C++ API
*************

Documentation on the C++ API is generated by Doxygen and it is available at the following links:

* `CUDA version <./cuda_api/index.html>`_ (default version)
* `HIP version <./hip_api/index.html>`_

The two versions only differ when it comes to the GPU kernels, so the great majority of the entries are identical. If you are unsure which version to use, take a look at the CUDA version.
