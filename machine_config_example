# Compute devices are created evenly based on the following settings.
num_nodes = 2
num_sockets_per_node = 2
num_cpus_per_socket = 10
num_gpus_per_socket = 2

# mem_device:
# Memories are created automatically. Currently, we support three kinds of memories - system memory, zero-copy memory, and GPU framebuffer memory. Each socket has one system memory (sys_mem) and one zero-copy memory (z_copy_mem); each GPU has one frame buffer memory (gpu_fb_mem).

# comm_device:
# Communication devices describe the links between the memories. Each communication device needs two parameters - latency in ms and bandwidth in GB/s. An easy way to get these numbers is using the Memspeed benchmark in legion/test/realm. Currently, we provide the following communication devices:
# memcpy 
membus_latency = 0.00003
membus_bandwidth = 4.26623
# inter-socket links
upi_latency = 0.0004
upi_bandwidth = 10.14039
# inter-node links, the third argument means the distribution of the NICs (O means one NIC per node and 1 means one NIC per socket)
nic_latency = 0.000507
nic_bandwidth = 10.9448431
nic_distribution = 0
# pci-e between CPU and GPU
pci_latency = 0.001
pci_bandwidth = 12.578468749999999
# nvlinks between GPUs
nvlink_latency = 0.001
nvlink_bandwidth = 18.52

# paths:
# This section describes the communication paths (a list of communication devices) between memories. These paths could change based on many factors, such as hardware, the version and settings of Gasnet and Legion. Please refer to the find_shortest_path function in legoin/runtime/realm/transfer/lowlevel_dma.cc to see the exact paths. 
# Setting a path to null will ignore any cost of the communications on that path.
